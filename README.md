# A-Driving-environment-emulator-for-testing-the-intelligence-of-autonomous-vehicles
My 4th year peoject By Gtoup 18

The project creates a simulated environment for camera sensors on autonomous vehicles. From the provided coordinate information, it will perform path prediction using Kalman Filter based on inputted velocity and steering angle. Then, the predicted coordinates will be passed to Google Street-view API, and it will return sets of street view images to continuously produce a simulated environment in real-time.
